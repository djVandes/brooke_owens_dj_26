                    <p>At the begining of my internship at Marvell, found myself in exactly this position. I knew 
                        this was a large company with interesting projects happening beyond my desk. Though I knew 
                        the tasks I had were important, their monotonous nature left me unmotivated and disenchanted 
                        with engineering. I feared this was all the next sixteen months had in store.</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title">So I made a choice; actively seek out the unknown.</h2>
                    <p>I met with my manager to discuss additional research opportunities and proposed that I explore 
                        AI applications in hardware design. Though initially wary about my juggling this alongside 
                        my primary responsibilities, my manager agreed and supported me in these new projects. I then 
                        had exciting oportunities to connect with researchers all over North America working on AI 
                        for hardware. Together we found a gap in the current literature, a reliable code generation 
                        tool for the notoriously difficult syntax of Verilog.</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title"> My new target was clear! </h2>
                    <p>
                        I had established a new goal, to create an AI code-generating tool 
                        using AWS to solve Marvell's ongoing problem of unreliable chatbots to assist hardware 
                        design. Though balancing these new oppotunities while performing my regular tasks required 
                        careful time management, through detailed documentation of my progress, I could quickly 
                        switch between my design work and AI research. With the feedback and support from senior 
                        engineers at Marvell, I engineered prompts, compared language models, and iterated on 
                        workflows relentlessly.

                    <p> Iteration after iteration failed basic syntax tests. I tried training a private 
                        model on the company's codebase, I tested the newest models ranked highest on 
                        code-generating leaderboards, but nothing worked! No matter how carefully I 
                        designed the single-agent system, it couldn't produce syntactically correct, 
                        compilable code without serious intervention. At that point, manual coding was 
                        faster. I considered giving up.

                    <h2 class="story-title">And finally, a breakthrough!</h2>
                    <p>Then I discovered multi-agent AI in the form of interacting language 
                        models that could self-correct with human oversight but little intervention. After experimenting 
                        with different agent workflows and prompts, I completed DIVA (Debugging AI Verilog Agents), 
                        my first ever research project! <br>
                        I presented it at an internal conference in Boston. Here, I finally met 
                        face-to-face the engineers throughout North America I had been working with remotely for over six months 
                        and many others who were interested by my work. 
                        While Marvell didn't adopt DIVA company-wide, the project
                        successfully generated functional RSA encryption code from documentation, something previous systems 
                        the company was considering couldn't do, and brought multi-agent workflows to the table.

                <p>This project pushed me beyond anything I'd designed in universityâ€”there with no clear roadmap,
                     no designated group, and no deadlines except the conference date. This experience fundamentally 
                     changed how I approach challenges and helped me realize what is possible through perseverance 
                     and passion over a project. Since then, I've pursued
                    numerous research projects involving image and text generation, all built from open-source 
                    documentation and frequent discussions with the lasting connections I made through this work. 
                    <br><br>I learned that I don't have to wait for opportunities to find me. I can seek them out, work
                    with a team, and create meaningful research developments!
