                    <p>At the beginning of my internship at Marvell, I found myself in exactly that position—assigned tasks that weren't challenging me. I knew this was a large company with interesting projects happening beyond my desk, and I knew that if I didn't assert myself by showing my managers what I could do, they would keep me in the same box.</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title">So I made a choice: I would actively seek out the work I wanted to do.</h2>
                    <p> I talked with my manager about taking on additional research alongside my assigned work, proposing that I explore AI applications in hardware design. Though initially wary about my juggling both responsibilities, my manager agreed. I began connecting with brilliant researchers working on AI for hardware, and discovered they were searching for reliable code generation tools for the notoriously difficult syntax of Verilog.</p>

                    <p>I wanted to create an AI code-generating tool using AWS to solve Marvell's ongoing problem of unreliable language models for hardware code.

This required careful time management. I documented my progress meticulously so I could quickly switch between my design work and AI research without losing my train of thought. I scheduled meetings to align with extremely busy senior engineers for feedback on both projects. I engineered prompts, compared language models, and iterated relentlessly.</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title">Then came the hard part. Trial and Error, and Error, and Error</h2>
                    <p> Iteration after iteration failed basic syntax tests. I tried training a private model on the company's codebase. I tested the newest models highest on code-generating leaderboards. Nothing worked! No matter how carefully I designed the single-agent system, it couldn't produce syntactically correct, compilable code without serious intervention. At that point, manual coding was faster. I considered giving up.</p>

                    <h2 class="story-title">And finally, a breakthrough happened!</h2>
                    <p>Then, in December 2024, a new paper introduced me to multi-agentic AI systems—interacting language models that could self-correct with human oversight but little intervention.
After experimenting with different agent workflows and prompts, I completed DIVA (Debugging AI Verilog Agents), my first research project! I presented it at an internal conference in Boston to senior engineers and connections I'd made in American offices whom I had yet to meet in person. While Marvell didn't adopt DIVA company-wide, I helped bring multi-agentic coding to the table—and it successfully generated RSA encryption code from written coding standards, something previous systems the company was considering couldn't do.</p>

                <p>The lasting connections I made became an inspiring group of engineers to discuss AI developments with, even as an intern. More importantly, I learned about my resilience in research. This project pushed me beyond anything I'd designed in university—there was no clear roadmap, no team, no deadlines except the conference date. I had to be entirely self-motivated.
My manager, initially wary, was extremely impressed with the result.
This experience fundamentally changed how I approach challenges. I now look more creatively at what I can do with my coding skills and passion for AI. Since then, I've pursued numerous projects involving image and text generation, all built from open-source documentation and frequent discussions with friends as enthralled with AI as I am. I learned that when I'm not being challenged, I don't wait for opportunity to find me—I seek it out, communicate what I want, and create it myself.
